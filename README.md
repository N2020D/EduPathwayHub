                  The Static website for Sri Lankan students to find ways to pursue higher education 
Abstract

EduPathwayHub was developed to address the significant challenges faced by Sri Lankan students, particularly those in rural areas, in accessing reliable and centralized information about higher education opportunities. The platform consolidated comprehensive data on government and private universities, foreign degree programs, vocational training institutes, scholarships, and online learning resources. By presenting this information in a categorized and easily navigable format, the website simplified the decision-making process for students. Designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, EduPathwayHub prioritized user-friendliness and accessibility to ensure a seamless browsing experience. This project aimed to bridge the information gap in Sri Lanka's education sector, empowering students to make informed choices about their academic and career paths. Ultimately, the website contributed to promoting equitable access to educational resources, supporting students in realizing their aspirations.

Introduction

In Sri Lanka, students transitioning from secondary to higher education encounter significant obstacles in identifying and accessing the best pathways for their future. Despite the growing number of educational institutions and opportunities available, the lack of a centralized platform for reliable information has left many students, particularly those in rural areas, at a disadvantage. Educational details are fragmented across various sources, such as government websites, institutional portals, and informal social media groups, making it challenging for students to gather and compare options comprehensively.
This project, EduPathwayHub, aims to provide a one-stop solution for Sri Lankan students, offering a user-friendly platform that consolidates critical information about higher education. It bridges the gap between students and accessible resources by categorizing data on local and international universities, vocational institutes, degree programs, scholarships, and other related opportunities. Through this initiative, the platform seeks to empower students with knowledge, enabling them to make informed decisions that align with their aspirations and capabilities.

Best Practices for Educational Websites
Using rem units for font sizes is a best practice for responsive and scalable typography. The rem (root rem) unit is relative to the root element's font size (html), typically set to 16px by default in most browsers.
Advantages of Using rem.
	Scalable Typography: Changing the root font size adjusts all font sizes proportionally.
	Responsive Design: Easy to create consistent typography that adapts to different screen sizes by adjusting the html font size.
	Accessibility: Allows users to scale text sizes in their browser settings without breaking the layout.
Element	Purpose	Recommended rem
Body Text	Main content	1rem (16px)
Headings (H1)	Main page title	2.5rem–3rem (40px–48px)
Headings (H2)	Section titles	2rem–2.5rem (32px–40px)
Headings (H3)	Subsection titles	1.5rem–2rem (24px–32px)
Headings (H4)	Smaller subsection titles	1.25rem–1.5rem (20px–24px)
Navigation	Menu links	0.875rem–1rem (14px–16px)
Footer Text		Secondary information	0.75rem–0.875rem (12px–14px)
Button Text	Call-to-action buttons	0.875rem–1rem (14px–16px)
